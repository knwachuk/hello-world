# hello-world Description
This is the preliminary introduction to Github for the Morgan State University Engineering Visualization Research Laboratory.

## Resources
Before anything else, visit [Introduction to Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and make a bookmark of [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Some guided instructions for a simpler introduction to git are [Codecademy's learn git series](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) and for a more in-depth dive into git, you can use [Udacity's How to Use Git and GitHub course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud775)

## Instructions
1. Make a fork of the [msu-evrl hello-world](https://github.com/msu-evrl/hello-world) repository.
2. Create a simple `hello world` program (in ANY language of your choice) named `hello_world_msuid.extension` e.g. `hello_world_kenwa1.py`.
3. Send a pull request to the main repository to accept your change.

## Added Information
You are allowed to modify this `README.md` file to provide more information on the project. Although the change must be accepted by the maintainer in order to be updated to the upstream [msu-evrl/hello-world](https://github.com/msu-evrl/hello-world) master.

#### Program Filename
The name of the program file should be of the form:
> `hello_world_msuid.extension`

For languages that do not allow filenames that include a underscores should retain the convention of the language. For example in Java,
> `HelloWorldMsuid.extension`
